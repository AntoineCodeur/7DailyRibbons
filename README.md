# Softwares requirements
-Python (works in 3.11.6 at least)
-Python modules: time, pydirectinput, pyautogui, pyperclip
-run_as_date 
-Desmume 
-An english or french rom of Platinum with your save in front of the ribbon girl (Note : didn't test with diamond and pearl but it should work, HGSS don't work) 

# Setup 
-Open desmume, use ctrl + O to go to the folder of your rom, cope the text of its whole name (with the .nds at the end), open it
-Save your game in front of the blonde girl who gives ribbons with the pokemon you want ribbons with in first position in your team (he must have 0 of these ribbons at the start)
-Close desmume
-Fill the userdata.txt document as follow:
  • In the first line : the name of your rom: paste what you copied just before
  • In the second line : the language of your rom: write 'EN' for an english rom, 'FR' for a french rom. Do not add spaces or line breaks
  • Save it and close it


# How to use
-Launch run_as_date. It must be set to launch your desmume application and the next 7 days need to be from the same month (ex. if it's the 30 august, set it to 1 september). Make the changes if necessary, close it and rerun it
-Run the file named 'exe.py'. You have 2 seconds to click back on run_as_date after that
-That's it, the program will launch your game itself and proceed to get the 7 ribbons
